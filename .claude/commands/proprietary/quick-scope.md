# Quick Scope Assessment

Ultra-fast assessment to understand project size. Perfect for mobile.

## Process

### Step 1: Get the Pitch

```
Give me your idea in one sentence:
```

Wait for response.

### Step 2: Five Quick Questions

Ask each, wait for answer:

1. **Users**: "How many people will use this? (just me / <100 / 100-1000 / 1000+)"

2. **Data**: "Does it need to save data? (no / local only / cloud/server)"

3. **Auth**: "Do users need accounts? (no / simple login / oauth/sso)"

4. **Integrations**: "Talk to other services? (no / 1-2 APIs / many integrations)"

5. **Polish**: "How polished? (prototype / mvp / production-quality)"

### Step 3: Scope Assessment

Based on answers, classify:

```
📊 SCOPE ASSESSMENT

Project: [their idea]

Size: [Tiny / Small / Medium / Large / Enterprise]

Timeline estimate:
- Tiny: 1-2 days
- Small: 1-2 weeks
- Medium: 1-2 months
- Large: 3-6 months
- Enterprise: 6+ months

Complexity factors:
- [List what adds complexity]

Simplification options:
- [Ways to reduce scope if needed]
```

### Step 4: Recommendation

```
My take:

[One paragraph honest assessment]

Want to:
1. Proceed as-is → I'll help plan it
2. Simplify → Let's cut scope
3. Expand → Actually, let's think bigger
4. Just exploring → Cool, let me know when you're ready
```

## Scoring Logic

**Tiny** (score 0-2):
- Just you + no server + no auth + no APIs + prototype

**Small** (score 3-5):
- Few users + local data + simple login + 1-2 APIs + MVP

**Medium** (score 6-8):
- 100+ users + cloud data + auth needed + some integrations + production

**Large** (score 9-11):
- 1000+ users + complex data + oauth + many integrations + full polish

**Enterprise** (score 12+):
- Massive scale + complex everything
