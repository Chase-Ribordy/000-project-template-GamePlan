# Notes
notes: |
  - This file is updated in real-time as agents are assigned and complete work
  - orc-exe reads this file to prevent double-assigning agents
  - Terminal IDs should match those in .system/parallel-work/active-sessions.yaml
  - Status values: running, waiting_approval, paused, completed, failed
