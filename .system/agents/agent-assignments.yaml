# Notes
notes: |
  - Each assignment is logged with full context for future optimization
  - Selection scores help refine the agent-selector algorithm over time
  - Outcome tracking enables performance metrics per agent
  - Duration tracking helps with capacity planning
  - This file grows over time - consider archiving after sprint completion
