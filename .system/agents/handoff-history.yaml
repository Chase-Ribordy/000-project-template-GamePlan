# Active handoffs (pending acceptance)
active:
  # Currently no active handoffs
  # Structure: same as handoffs above, but status: pending

# Handoff patterns (for optimization)
patterns:
  # Common handoff chains
  component_lifecycle:
    - contract-architect → validation-controller
    - validation-controller → integration-manager
    - integration-manager → orchestrator-exe (completion report)

  story_implementation:
    - development-executor → testing-specialist
    - testing-specialist → validation-controller
    - validation-controller → orchestrator-exe (completion report)

# Statistics

    # Tracks handoff frequency between agent pairs

# Notes
notes: |
  - Handoffs are contract-based: clear inputs, outputs, acceptance criteria
  - Event-driven handoffs are automatic, orchestrator/agent-request are manual
  - Failed handoffs should escalate to orchestrator-exe
  - Patterns help predict workflow bottlenecks
  - Active handoffs are moved to history upon completion
