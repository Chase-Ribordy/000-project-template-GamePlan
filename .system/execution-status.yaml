# Notes
notes: |
  This execution-status.yaml file will be populated when you start working on stories.

  Quick start:
  1. Use BMAD to create PRD, architecture, and stories (/pm, /architect, /create-epics-and-stories)
  2. Run /dev-story [story-name] to start first pass
  3. Run /integrate [prototype] to start second pass
  4. Track progress automatically via autonomous skills

  The progress-reporter skill will auto-update this file as components move through the workflow.
