# Proven Components

## Purpose
Components that passed ALL validation levels

## Entry Requirements
- ✅ Syntax valid
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Contract compliant
- ✅ Integration safe
- ✅ Sandbox tested

## What Goes Here
Only components that have been fully validated and proven to work

## Workflow
1. Build component in components/
2. Run progressive validation
3. Test in sandbox
4. If ALL pass: MCP tool `mark_as_proven` moves here
5. Integration uses proven/ components

## Quality Gate
**No component integrates without being proven first**
