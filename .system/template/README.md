# Project Template Documentation

This folder contains documentation **about the template itself** - how it works, how to use it, and how it's structured.

## Quick Navigation

### Getting Started
- **[README-QUICKSTART.md](README-QUICKSTART.md)** - Get up and running in 5 minutes
- **[mcp-setup.md](mcp-setup.md)** - MCP server setup and troubleshooting

### Understanding the Template
- **[README-STRUCTURE.md](README-STRUCTURE.md)** - Folder architecture and patterns
- **[README-BUILD-PLAN.md](README-BUILD-PLAN.md)** - Development philosophy and principles
- **[README-USAGE.md](README-USAGE.md)** - Advanced template usage

### Workflows
- **[integration-workflow.md](integration-workflow.md)** - Component integration process

## Template vs Project Docs

**This folder (`.template/`)**: Documentation about how the template works
- Setup guides
- Architecture explanations
- Workflow descriptions
- Template philosophy
- Reference material about the template itself

**`docs/` folder**: Your project's knowledge base
- PRDs, architecture decisions
- Planning notes
- Generated by BMAD workflows
- Project-specific documentation
- Initially empty when you start a new project

## What Is This Template?

A quality-first development template for building modular web components with:

- **Contract-driven development** - Define interfaces before coding
- **Progressive validation** - 4 levels of quality gates
- **Component architecture** - Prevent context window blowout
- **MCP-powered safety** - Automated conflict detection
- **Full SDLC workflows** - 37 BMAD commands + 8 custom commands

## Key Concepts

### The "Slow is Fast" Principle
- Contract (10 min) → Test (20 min) → Code (30 min) → Validate (10 min) → Sandbox (10 min)
- **Total: 80 minutes with zero integration bugs**
- vs. Traditional: Code (30 min) → Debug (3 hours) → Fix (2 hours) = **5.5 hours**

### Quality-First Workflow
1. **contracts/** - Define what it should do (BEFORE coding)
2. **validation/** - Progressive validation (syntax → tests → contracts → integration)
3. **sandbox/** - Prove it works in isolation
4. **proven/** - Only validated components integrate

### Component-Driven Architecture
- **components/** - Small pieces (50-200 lines)
- **references/** - Complete prototypes (500-2000 lines)
- **Main files** - Injection markers only
- **Assembly** - MCP validates, no conflicts

## Example Component

See `components/example-button/` for a complete working example demonstrating:
- Contract → Test → Code → Sandbox → Proven workflow
- Proper CSS namespacing
- TDD with 13 tests
- Clean API with destroy pattern
- Interactive sandbox testing

## Slash Commands

### Quality Commands (8)
- `/define-contract` - Contract-first development
- `/validate-component` - 4-level validation
- `/prove-it-works` - Sandbox testing
- `/integrate` - Safe component integration
- `/checklist` - Environment validation
- `/next-steps` - Session handoff
- `/debug-css` - Self-checking debugger
- `/integrate-mcp` - MCP setup wizard

### BMAD Workflows (37)
- Full SDLC coverage from research → deployment
- Product management, architecture, development, testing
- See `.claude/commands/bmad/` for complete list

## Quick Start

1. **Copy template** to your project folder
2. **Run `/checklist`** to validate environment
3. **Study `components/example-button/`** to see the workflow
4. **Read [README-QUICKSTART.md](README-QUICKSTART.md)** for step-by-step guide
5. **Build your first component** using quality workflow

## Philosophy

**Validation is cheaper than debugging.**

This template enforces quality gates that prevent bugs rather than fixing them later:
- Contracts prevent 70% of integration bugs
- Tests catch bugs in seconds, not hours
- Sandbox proves it works before integration
- MCP prevents CSS conflicts and dependency issues

## Template Updates

When updating this template:
- Keep `.template/` docs about the template
- Don't put project-specific content here
- Update `README-QUICKSTART.md` for new features
- Keep example components current
