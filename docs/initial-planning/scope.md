# [Project Name] - Scope Document

> Apply the Pareto Principle: 20% of features that deliver 80% of value.

## MVP Scope (IN)

**Core features that MUST ship:**

- [ ] **[Feature 1]**: [one-line description]
- [ ] **[Feature 2]**: [one-line description]
- [ ] **[Feature 3]**: [one-line description]

**Why these specifically?**
[Explain the logic behind your choices]

## Backlog (OUT of MVP)

**Good ideas, but not now:**

| Feature | Reason for Deferral | Priority for Later |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [Feature A] | [too complex for MVP] | High |
| [Feature B] | [nice-to-have, not critical] | Medium |
| [Feature C] | [requires infrastructure not yet built] | Low |

## Constraints

### Time
- **Deadline/Target**: [date or timeframe]
- **Available hours**: [estimate if relevant]

### Technical
- **Must use**: [required technologies, frameworks]
- **Cannot use**: [prohibited or unavailable tools]
- **Platform requirements**: [browser support, device targets]

### Resources
- **Team size**: [number of people/agents]
- **Budget**: [if applicable]
- **External dependencies**: [APIs, services needing approval]

## Assumptions

**We are assuming:**

1. [Assumption about users]
2. [Assumption about technology]
3. [Assumption about timeline]
4. [Assumption about scope]

**If these are wrong:**
[What would change?]

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1: e.g., API rate limits] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Plan B] |
| [Risk 2: e.g., scope creep] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Plan B] |
| [Risk 3: e.g., tech complexity] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Plan B] |

## Definition of Done (MVP)

**MVP is complete when:**

- [ ] [Specific criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific criterion 3]
- [ ] User can [complete core journey]
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Basic error handling

## Scope Creep Prevention

**Out of scope explicitly:**
- [Thing people might ask for but we're not doing]
- [Common feature request we're intentionally skipping]
- [Polish/optimization we'll defer]

**How to handle requests:**
1. Log in backlog
2. Evaluate against MVP criteria
3. Only include if it blocks core value
