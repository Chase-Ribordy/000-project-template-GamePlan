# Physique Check Match System - Ideas

**Working Session:** 2025-11-22
**Status:** Brainstorming

---

## Core Concept

Match fitness clients with bodybuilders/celebrities who share similar physical traits → generate visual "match analysis" reports → post as social media video content.

**Why this matters:** Engaging content hook for fitness coaches. Clients love seeing "you're built like [famous person]."

---

## Match Criteria (The Dataset)

Input data points for matching:
- **Muscle insertions** - where muscles attach (genetic)
- **Biomechanics** - movement patterns, limb ratios
- **Height**
- **Weight**

Match against:
- Bodybuilders (competition data?)
- Famous people / celebrities with known stats

---

## Output / Use Case

1. **Screen report** - Visual "match analysis" display
2. **Video content** - Recorded/exported for social media posting
3. **Web app** - Highly visual interface that looks good on camera

**Flow:** Client data → Match found → Generate visual report → Record screen → Post to social

## Questions to Explore

- [ ] Where does the bodybuilder/celebrity dataset come from?
- [ ] How do coaches input client muscle insertion data?
- [ ] What does the visual report look like?
- [ ] Video export built-in, or screen record?
- [ ] Who's the user - the coach or the client?

## Notes

- Content play for fitness influencers/coaches
- Visual-first design (needs to look good on video)
- Dataset is the moat - hard to replicate
